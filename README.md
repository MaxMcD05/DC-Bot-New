DC Bot 2.0 is an attempt to create a discord bot that responds to translate: "word" and use a translator api and enter a word needed to be translated (in discord) and recieving the output of the word you typed in its inverse language. I have been running into problems extracting the value from the translator itself and putting it into response form for discord. If i kept working on this, I would work to solve those problems and potentially make an option to switch languages beyond just english and chinese.

Here is a source that helped me with fetch: https://learnwithparam.com/blog/how-to-handle-fetch-errors/

The most challenging part of this project is definately interpreting the API and trying to make my code work for its api.

I definetly recommend looking into the api I used: https://github.com/matheuss/google-translate-api where I installed the following into the shell: 
npm install --save google-translate-api
