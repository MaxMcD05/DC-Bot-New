The difference between in loops and of loops and why if loops worked and in loops did not.

“The for...in statement is useful for iterating over object properties, but to iterate over iterable objects like arrays and strings, we use the for...of statement”. In order to make a dictionary in my bot, it required a for… of loop to control the overall e: and c: rather than each property within.

What my bot does: My bot allows the user to enter translate: (a word) and that it knows (you can see what words it knows by typing “translate: english” or “translate: chinese” for a word bank. The bot will output the translation in Chinese or back to English.

My Bot does not use command handling so I am required to explain what that is. I believe command handling to be the process of splitting commands into different parts (or files) to prevent having a bunch of if/else statements.  Sorry for the rush on the description of my bot, I’m in a strange spot at the moment.
