DC Bot 2.0 is an attempt to use a translator api and enter a word needed to be translated (in discord) and recieving the output of the word you typed in its inverse language. I have been running into problems extracting the value from the translator itself and putting it into response form for discord. If i kept working on this, I would work to solve those problems and potentially make an option to switch languages beyond just english and chinese.
